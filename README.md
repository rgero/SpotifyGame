# The Spotify Game
This game is based on something I like to do when I am walking around while listening to music. I simply put a playlist on shuffle and then try to guess what artist or track is playing. I get a point if I get either right, lose one if I am wrong.

The problem with doing this manually is that I often forget the score. It'd be cool if something kept track of it for me.

That's where this could come in.

It's going to be interesting to see if I can construct or find a Spotify player that allows the user to select a playlist, or an artist, or use their currently playing spotify to do this. I think the first implementation will be mostly computer based so currently playing might not be a bad idea.
